# RefinedSzn / Web Development Project
Developed using **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **React**, and **Bootstrap** in Summer 2022 to gather experience in front-end web development.

The web application is based on a now-defunct automotive enthusiast community that I used to run from late 2020 to early 2023.

The running website build can be found [here](https://phamstatic.github.io/RefinedSzn-Project/).

## Project Features
- React.js front-end framework to implement building user interfaces using components and JavaScript. 
- Bootstrap framework and components such as the gallery and navigation bar.
- Multipage hosting through the React Router framework using hash routing (webpage host does not support browser routing).
- Mobile device responsiveness using CSS media queries (screen device sizes).
- Unique CSS style sheets for each created component.
