# RefinedSzn Project
Developed using **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, **React**, and **Bootstrap**

Created for my automotive enthusiast community that I founded and run, [RefinedSzn](https://www.instagram.com/refinedszn/).

## Explanation
This website application simply shows UI you would expect at a typical website. It contains a navigation bar that leads you to other pages and displays information about the organization in easily readable form, whether it appears on a desktop system or a mobile device.

I decided to use **React** as it is the leading web development library in the industry and allows for easy utilization of components for creating websites. **Bootstrap** was another handy framework I found that made my life a lot easier in that it allowed for easier styling and came with custom components.

## Challenges
As it was my first ever React application and first serious web development project, there were an immense amount of challenges I faced while developing this website.

###### Centering
Admittedly, I did not know how to center a div consistently until I started doing it a lot for this project.

###### Including the Bootstrap Framework
I had to use a lot of online resources to figure out how to implement Bootstrap into React. Once I did though, it made my life a lot more easier.

###### Hosting Multiple Pages w/ React
React applications already come standard with one App.js to develop as a home page in itself. It took a lot of time figuring out how to use React Router to connect multiple pages together. Additionally, there's a quirk about GitHub Pages that forced me to use a Hash Router instead of a Browser Router.

###### Mobile Device Responsiveness
This was one of the worst things to figure out how to work around. The project looked so good on the big screen, but when I opened up inspect element or my iPhone, the website would shrink intensely to an unreadable size. I did end up finding out about CSS's @media component though. Regardless, I am still learning how to be bette at optimizing websites for smaller screens.
